# racket-p5

Uses [soegaard](https://github.com/soegaard)'s [urlang](https://github.com/soegaard/urlang) compiler to give p5.js Racket-y syntax.

## Setup

`git clone`

## Usage

Look at `p5.rkt`

## Why?

Racket > JS.

## How it works

Gives declarations for p5.js identifiers to urlang.
TODO: output options and some way of using Racket procedures as urlang macros

## Is it any good?

~~not yet~~ Yes.
